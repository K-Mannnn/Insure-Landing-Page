## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project proved to be a layout oriented challenge, I learnt a lot about position an element in a document and various CSS limitations in doing so, such limitations of background-image property but also some additional methods on that property to achieve desired results. It has bit of Javascript to toggle the navbar menu in mobile view. 

### Continued development

I got to practice around the position property in CSS during this challenge quite a bit, would like improve my understanding of it in more detail.
